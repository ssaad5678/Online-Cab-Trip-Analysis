# Online Cab Trip Analysis and Clustering Application 📊

## Introduction ℹ️

This project aims to analyze and cluster data related to the SP-500 index. Using Streamlit, Python, and various data analysis techniques, it provides insights into the dataset's characteristics and performs K-means clustering for segmentation.

## Aim 🎯

The primary goal is to understand the patterns and trends within the customer dataset, utilizing clustering techniques to segment the data for better analysis and interpretation.

## Methodologies 📈

- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), missing value visualization, categorical data examination.
- **K-means Clustering:** Determining optimal clusters using elbow method and silhouette analysis.
- **Machine Learning:** Using K-means to segment SP-500 data for insights.

## Tools and Frameworks 🛠️

- **Streamlit:** Rapid app development
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn
- **Missingno:** Visualizing missing data patterns
- **PIL:** Image processing for data visualization

## Description 📝

The project involves uploading an customer dataset, exploring missing data patterns, analyzing categorical variables, and identifying trends in trip data. It also performs K-means clustering to segment the data.

## Results 📊

- Identified significant round trips in December.
- Discovered high cab traffic in select locations.
- Found that most cab rides are within a 35-mile radius, taking about 30 minutes.

## Future Enhancements 🚀

- Incorporate more advanced clustering algorithms.
- Develop predictive models for trip duration or fare estimation.
- Enhance visualization techniques for better insights.
